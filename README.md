ASU-CSE-320-PerfectFit
======================

This is a rails app created for a class project for ASU's CSE360 class. It is a health tracker webapp that will run on any rails enabled server. 

You can demo the site from:
http://perfectfit.redxns.com

Server Configuration:
=====================
ruby: v2.0.0

after configuring rails and ruby on your server run these commands:
$ bundle install --without production
$ rake db:migrate
$ passanger start 

you can they access the app localy at:
http://localhost:3000

I have made a website for the company! I hope it helps. We could hopefully get the rails working so we could have people demo from this website. If by any chance the old domain name still exists we could use that but for now this is a great way to star and the site is already live. and below is the domain name.
